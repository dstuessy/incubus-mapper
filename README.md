# Incubus Mapper

A tilemap level editor, nothing more to it.

Work in progress, you're not gonna get much out of this.

Run the app using [Love2D](https://www.love2d.org/). Install the engine somewhere on your machine and add it to your PATH.
Then execute the following command.

``` sh
$ love . <target/tileset.png> <target/savefile>
```

**Note:** due to limitations with Love2D, the save file is found within Love2D's save folder on your machine. This will vary between different operating systems. See the [Love2D documentation](https://www.love2d.org/wiki/love.filesystem) for your machine's save file location.
